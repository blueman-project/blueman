	Frequently Asked Questions About Blueman

 1.	I have a problem - how do I begin the debugging process?

	To retrieve useful information, the best starting point is to run 
	"blueman-applet" from a terminal window. Since only one instance may
	be running at a time, you will first need to stop any instances 
	already running (use "ps x | grep [b]lueman" to find the pid and then 
	run "kill ####" or use "killall blueman-applet").

	There will be plenty of output in the terminal window, which will also
	include messages from blueman-manager. 

	See our Troubleshooting page for more information on this process:

 2.	The blueman applet does not show any detected bluetooth adapters - what
	is wrong?

	First, make sure that your kernel supports your bluetooth device. You 
	can use "bluez-test-adapter" (for BlueZ-4.x) or "bluetoothctl list"
	(for BlueZ-5.x) to see if your device is recognized. If it is not, 
	then either your kernel doesn't support the device or some hardware
	killswitch is preventing it from working.

	To check for killswitch problems, first ensure that you have rfkill 
	support enabled in your kernel and it is loaded (i.e. the "rfkill"
	module is loaded or it is built into your kernel statically).
	Check the output of "rfkill list" and ensure that the bluetooth device
	is not listed as either "Soft blocked" or "Hard blocked" - if it is,
	then use the appropriate rfkill command to remove a soft block, and/or
	check for a hardware switch on your machine to remove a hard block.

	To check for kernel support, use "lsusb" and/or "lspci" to find the
	hardware ID and do a web search to determine whether it should be 
	supported.  If you are not sure how to do this and/or are not sure
	how to interpret the results, scroll to the bottom of this document
	for information on how to open an issue with the Blueman project.


 3.	How do I install blueman on my operating system?
 
	Consult your operating system's documentation and/or help areas;
	blueman is probably either already installed or available already
	in a package repository.


 4.	I have another question or am experiencing some other issue/bug: 
	Now what?

	For bugs in blueman, we recommend that you first attempt to resolve
	any issues through your OS vendor's designated support areas to 
	ensure that problems aren't caused by e.g. packaging issues or
	OS-specific configurations.  If you've already tried that and still
	are unable to solve your problem, visit our Troubleshooting page:

		https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/wiki/Troubleshooting

	and if needed, open a new issue:

		https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/issues

	Be sure to provide the blueman version you are using, the version of
	bluez you are running, your kernel version, your operating system
	name and version, and the desktop environment you are running.
